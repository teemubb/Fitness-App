# Fitness App

This project was a fitness app made for a programming course in university, where the goal was to design and implement an UI. The project was made with Java Swing.

> [!NOTE]  
This project was originally done with a partner. I've since re-uploaded it to my own repository since original repository was private and also have added further improvements and enhancements independently.

## Features

- A desktop application for tracking meals and physical activity made with Swing.

- Dynamic UI that changes based on user input to different views.

- Main view updates real-time based on user's entered meals and selected plans.

- Some basic functionality to test the UI implementation such as personalisation options, plan selection etc.

- PostgreSQL database for storing added meals.


## Possible improvements


- Adding better functionality to make the app more usable.
