# Fitness App

This project is a fitness app made for a programming course in university, where the goal was to design and implement an UI. The project was made with Java Swing using PostgreSQL for data storage.

> [!NOTE]  
This project was originally done with a partner for a course focused on UI programming.
> I've since re-uploaded it to my own repository since original repository was private, and have since continued development independently. 
> Most of the current functionality and enhancements were added after this and are my own work.

## Features

- A desktop application for tracking meals (and physical activity) with a dynamic UI that changes based on user input to different views made with Swing.

- Adding and editing meals. Users can add new meals and update existing ones (by double clicking them) on the database through the UI.

- Main view updates real-time from the database based on user's entered meals (and selected plans).

- Some basic functionality to test rest of the UI implementation such as personalisation options, plan selection etc. (Proper functionality to be implemented...)

- PostgreSQL database for storing added meals.


## Possible improvements


- Adding more features such as exercises, saving user data to db etc...
- Spring boot for multi platform usage?
