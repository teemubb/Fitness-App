# Fitness App

This project was a fitness app made for a programming course, where the goal was to design and implement an UI. The project was made with Java Swing.

> [!NOTE]  
This project was done with a partner, reuploaded to my own repository since original repository was set private.

## Features

- A desktop application made with Swing

- Dynamic UI that changes based on user input to different views.

- Main view updates real-time based on user's entered meals and selected plans.

- Some basic functionality to test the UI implementation such as personalisation options, plan selection etc,

- Some of the data is hardcoded.


## Possible improvements

- Improving the consistency between different views

- Adding proper functionality to make the app usable

- Some sort of database to save progress between app launches.
